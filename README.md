# Miscellaneous Combustion and Heat Calculations

## Project Description
This project includes various calculations related to combustion and heat transfer, focusing on thermodynamic properties and combustion modeling. MATLAB scripts are used to perform the computations and generate visualizations for better understanding.

## Features
- **Heat Transfer Calculations**:
  - Computes thermodynamic properties such as specific heats and enthalpies.
- **Combustion Modeling**:
  - Models combustion processes and generates relevant data.
- **Visualization**:
  - Provides plots for combustion and thermodynamic property trends.

## Included Files
- `coefficients.mlx`: Defines coefficients for thermodynamic property calculations.
- `calculations_NASA.mlx`: Contains NASA polynomial calculations for combustion species.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020b or higher.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rmodregoe/combustion-heat-calculations.git
   ```
2. Open the `.mlx` files in MATLAB Live Editor.
3. Execute the scripts to perform the calculations and generate visualizations.

## Results
- Outputs include thermodynamic property values, combustion parameters, and relevant plots.
- Visual aids provide insights into combustion efficiency and heat transfer.
